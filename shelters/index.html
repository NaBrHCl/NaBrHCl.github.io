        War, Civilian and Home
    </h1>
    <div>
        Throughout history, wars have always had negative influences on human society. The brutality of war is often
        linked with casualties of soldiers on the battlefield. However, civilians are equally affected during
        wartime. On this webpage, the impact of war on civilians and their homes will be discussed.

            <h2>Impact of war on civilians</h2>
            Civilians are affected by war in many ways, with the most significant one being physical harm.
            <img src="https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/765261/fpubh-09-765261-HTML/image_m/fpubh-09-765261-t001.jpg"
                alt="The outcome of wars/conflicts in terms of mortality." style="width: 80%"><br>
            In recent centuries, with the advance in technology and change in warfare ideology, civilian fatality has
            increased noticeably. From 5% around the beginning of the 19th century, to 15% during World War I, to 65% by
            the end of World War II and to over 90% in wars during 1990's. More and more civilians are losing
            their lives as a result of the conflicts.<a class="citation">[1]</a><br><br>
            The film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_of_the_Fireflies">Grave of the Fireflies</a> embodied
            this with the scenes of civilians escaping from incendiary bombs (8:20), civilian casualties placed in
            school acting as hospital(15:40) and cremation of dead civilians(19:50)<br><br>

            War also brings psychological trauma to civilians.<br>
            A survey aimed to study mentality and disability in postwar Afghanistan revealed that 67.7% of respondents
            show symptoms of depression, 71.7% of them show symptoms of anxiety.<a class="citation">[2]</a><br>
            War leads to lack of supply.<br>
            "Among the 815 million people suffering from chronic malnutrition in 2016, 60 percent lived in areas
            affected by armed conflict." <a class="citation">[3]</a><br>
            This is also seen in the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_of_the_Fireflies">Grave of
                the Fireflies</a>, where rationing in Japan during World War II is presented, as well as food
            shortage for many civilians. At 59:30, we can see the line of a farmer: "I'm a farmer, but even I don't
            have any rice to share."<br><br>

            <h2>Civilian displacement caused by war</h2>
            Many civilians affected either directly (injury, casualty) or indirectly (destruction of
            infrastructure, lack of supply) by war would settle in regions with safer conditions.<br><br>

            At the end of 2022, around 108.4 million people are forced to displace worldwide, with 35.3 million of them
            being refugees, 62.5 million of them being IDPS (internally displaced person(s)). Among these refugees, 6
            million of them returned to where they're from.<br> 76% of these people are hosted in low- and middle-income
            countries, with 20% of them hosted in the least developed countries.<a class="citation">[4]</a><br>
            22% of these refugees - about 6.6 million people live in refugee camps<a class="citation">[5]</a>, while
            the majority of them (over 60% of refugees, around 50% of IDPs) live in urban areas.<a
                class="citation">[6]</a><br><br>

            People in refugee camps receive humanitarian aids including but not limited to shelter, medical care, food
            and water.<a class="citation">[7]</a>However, these people face many difficulties. Such as lack of
            education and suboptimal living environment. Due to the number of children exceeding
            the number of students that schools can accommodate in refugee camps, about 48% of refugee children are
            unable to attend school.<a class="citation">[8]</a>Many Syrian families living in refugee camps don't have
            roofs over their shelter.<a class="citation">[9]</a>In a report about a refugee camp in Palestine, it is
            revealed that 48% of houses had one window only, and 50% of them had two windows, which leads to poor
            ventilation. Furthermore, concrete roofs are commonly found in houses, which causes presence of damp.<a
                class="citation">[10]</a>According to another report about a refugee camp in Lebanon, 83.3% of
            households indicated cockroach infestation.<a class="citation">[11]<br><br>

            </a>This can be linked to the podcast <a href="https://shelternj.org/podcast-blog/02">What Shelter Means to
                Me</a>, in which houseless artist Denis Elmore described his housing environment: "And this mold in
            every place, ceiling is wide open, the bathroom is ... a little cut-out with a toilet space" (9:30)<br><br>

            Generally speaking, life is easier for refugees living in urban area compared to those living in refugee
            camps. Although they are still met with numerous challenges. Take the case of Hindu Rohingya refugees who
            migrated to Bangladesh as example, it's much harder for them to find quality jobs compared to the locals due
            to racial discrimination.<a class="citation">[12]</a><br>
            Many Ukranian refugees only have limited access to basic services. Many don't have free health care due to
            the lack of awareness towards refugees' rights. Only 30% - 70% of child refugees are enrolled in local
            schools due to language barrier and local school capacity.<a class="citation">[13]</a>

            <h2>Meaning of home to war-affected civilians</h2>
            The concept of home is the concept of appropriation of a space which means the aspect of making something
            your own by making it feel like your own.<br><br>

            There's the main aspect that makes home feel like home. Number 1 is material aspects which contain
            protection, comfort and presentation of aesthetic values. Number 2 is the spatial aspect which contains
            zoning, housing typology, and connectedness to the surrounding landscape. Number 3 is the relational aspect
            which contains relationships with other people and the sense of attachment and security. The fourth aspect
            to define home is the temporal aspect which is the memories of lost homes or the images of an ideal home.<br><br>

            All this is very difficult for a war affected civilian to do, if you look at the war in Ukraine, they're not
            capable of doing aspects to create a sense of home because of the war. They are not capable of doing it
            either because it is destroyed and will never look as beautiful as it once did or because they have lost
            someone who made it feel like home.<br><br>

            There is also another aspect for why they will probably never feel at home in their country. They have seen
            terrible things be done or they have had to do terrible things to be able to survive and it is very
            difficult to feel at home. Home does not necessarily mean a building of some sorts, it could mean someone.
            In the book home at page 117 in the section beyond home speaks of the fact that home can sometime be beyond
            just a building but a person, but this could be hard for a war-affected civilian because of the fact that
            you could have lost the person that was you're home ether because you lost touch with them either because
            they have died. So it is much more difficult for a war affected civilian to make a home connection with a
            human being because after going through a war and surviving it could be difficult to trust someone new to
            that level.<br><br>
