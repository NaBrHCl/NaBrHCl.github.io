        War, Civilian and Home
    </h1>
    <div>
        Throughout history, wars have always had negative influences on human society. The brutality of war is often
        linked with casualties of soldiers on the battlefield. However, civilians are equally affected during
        wartime. On this webpage, the impact of war on civilians and their homes will be discussed.

            Civilians are affected by war in many ways, with the most significant one being physical harm.
            <img src="https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/765261/fpubh-09-765261-HTML/image_m/fpubh-09-765261-t001.jpg"
                alt="The outcome of wars/conflicts in terms of mortality." style="width: 80%"><br>
            In recent centuries, with the advance in technology and change in warfare ideology, civilian fatality has
            increased noticeably. From 5% around the beginning of the 19th century, to 15% during World War I, to 65% by
            the end of World War II and to over 90% in wars during 1990's. More and more civilians are losing
            their lives as a result of the conflicts.<a class="citation">[1]</a><br><br>
            The film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_of_the_Fireflies">Grave of the Fireflies</a> embodied
            this with the scenes of civilians escaping from incendiary bombs (8:20), civilian casualties placed in
            school acting as hospital(15:40) and cremation of dead civilians(19:50)<br><br>

            War also brings psychological trauma to civilians.<br>
            A survey aimed to study mentality and disability in postwar Afghanistan revealed that 67.7% of respondents
            show symptoms of depression, 71.7% of them show symptoms of anxiety.<a class="citation">[2]</a><br>

            War leads to lack of supply.<br>
            "Among the 815 million people suffering from chronic malnutrition in 2016, 60 percent lived in areas
            affected by armed conflict." <a class="citation">[3]</a><br>
            This is also seen in the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_of_the_Fireflies">Grave of
                the Fireflies</a>, where rationing in Japan during World War II is presented, as well as food
            shortage for many civilians. At 59:30, we can see the line of a farmer: "I'm a farmer, but even I don't
            have any rice to share."<br><br>

            <h2>Civilian displacement caused by war</h2>
            Many civilians affected either directly (injury, casualty) or indirectly (destruction of
            infrastructure, lack of supply) by war would settle in regions with safer conditions.<br><br>
            <!-- https://www.unhcr.org/global-trends-report-2022 -->
            At the end of 2022, around 108.4 million people are forced to displace worldwide, with 35.3 million of them
            being refugees, 62.5 million of them being IDPS (internally displaced person(s)). Among these refugees, 6
            million of them returned to where they're from.<br> 76% of these people are hosted in low- and middle-income
            countries, with 20% of them hosted in the least developed countries.<a class="citation">[4]</a><br>
            <!-- https://www.unrefugees.org/news/refugee-camps-explained/ -->
            22% of these refugees - about 6.6 million people live in refugee camps<a class="citation">[5]</a>, while
            the majority of them (over 60% of refugees, around 50% of IDPs) live in urban areas.<a
                class="citation">[6]</a><br><br>
            People in refugee camps receive humanitarian aids including but not limited to shelter, medical care, food
            and water.<a class="citation">[7]</a>
