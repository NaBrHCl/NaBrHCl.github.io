                $ 3.00 of 6-pack cucumbers bought at local supermarket<br><br>
                <a href="https://www.serrestoundra.com/">Serres Toundra</a>, the producer of cucumbers adopts <a
                    href="https://www.serrestoundra.com/pages/a-propos#st_implication">measures</a>
                to actively protect the environment.<br><br>
                For example, the polystyrene in the package is replaced with
                compostable cardboard to avoid pollution.<br><br>
                Another example is that the company uses rain water to
                irrigate its plants instead of potable water.

                operated by citizens collectively.<br><br>
                Based on a <a
                    href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238742667_Health_Benefits_of_Urban_Agriculture">study</a>
                in 2004, community gardens help citizens improve mental health, promote relaxation and decrease crime
                rates. <a href="https://www.greenleafcommunities.org/the-many-benefits-of-community-gardens/">Greenleaf
                    Communities</a><br><br>
                Furthermore, according to documentary<a href="https://www.tomorrow-documentary.com/">Tomorrow</a>,
                governments encourage the most competitive farmers in order to gain greater amount of yield. This is to
                achieve a lower price of food so that it's acceptable for consumers, but there are negative impacts on
                the environment, like more use of pesticides causing increasing pollutions. Buying from community garden
                is a way to aid the environment in that sense.

    <h2>Positives and Negatives of food</h2>
    <div>
        <h3>Positive: Local Food</h3>
        <p>
            Shorter distance of transportation means less greenhouse gas emissions. According to a <a
                href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es702969f">study</a> in 2008, about 11%
            of food's greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation. <a
                href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2012/09/04/how-green-is-local-food/">Columbia - How
                Green is Local Food </a><br><br>
            Information from another <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/greenhouse-gas-emissions-food">article</a>
            suggests that food accounts for around 25% to 30% of global emissions.<br><br>
            Malik Yakini, the co-manager of D-Town farm (Detroit) says that food travels for 15 000 miles on average in
            the US, which makes food transportation a factor we must consider in order to reduce greenhouse gas
            emissions. <a href="https://www.tomorrow-documentary.com/">Tomorrow</a>

        <h3>Positive: Farmer's Market</h3>
        <p>
            Buying from farmer's market stimulates the economy.<br><br>
            While many large enterprises transfer the profit to other places of the world, farmer's markets help keep
            the prosperity locally. It also helps with local economy: "for every $100 spent at a small business, $68 is
            circumvented back into the local economy" <a
                href="https://www.locatelocal.ca/how-does-buying-local-food-help-the-economy/">Locate
                Local</a><br><br>
            Moreover, it helps with national economy: "Growers selling
            locally create 13 full time jobs per $1 million in revenue earned. Those that do not sell locally create 3."

        <h3>Positive: Healthy Diet</h3>
        <p>
            Documentary <a href="https://www.tomorrow-documentary.com/">Tomorrow</a> reveals that humans evolved to
            have a diet mainly consisting of perennial plants like certain fruits and vegetables. Nowadays about 60% of
            our diet is made up of grains, which our organism isn't designed for. According to <a
                href="https://www.eatthis.com/effects-going-grain-free/">Eat This, Not That</a>, a grain-based diet may
            increase risk of cardiovascular disease and lead to nutritional deficiency.<br><br>
            However, In this local & zero waste meal, the majority of food are vegetables, making it healthy and
            suitable for our body.

        <h3>Negative: Lack of GMO (Genetically Modified Organism)</h3>
        <p>
            GMO is good for the environment as many GM plants have more yield and less need for pesticide compared to
            non-GM ones.<br><br>
            "Over the last 25 years, GMOs have reduced pesticide applications by 7.2% and helped increase crop yields by
            22%."<br><br>
            Thanks to crop biotechnology, many crops gained massive increase in yield between 1996 and 2020. For
            example, the yield of soybeans increased by 363.76 million tons and that of corn increased by 655.87 million
            tons. Without the presence of GMO, the same needs to be achieved with 57.8 million more acres of
            land.<br><br>
